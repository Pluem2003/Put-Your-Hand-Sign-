## 🐛 Step 14: Troubleshooting Verification

### Server Issues
If server won't start:
- [ ] Check Node.js installed: `node --version`
- [ ] Check npm installed: `npm install --version`
- [ ] Check npm install ran: `dir node_modules` shows express
- [ ] Check port 6527 free: `netstat -ano | findstr :6527`
- [ ] Try different port: `set PORT=3001` then `npm start`

### Camera Issues
If no camera feed:
- [ ] Check camera works: Open Windows Camera app
- [ ] Check browser permissions: Check browser settings
- [ ] Check incognito mode
- [ ] Try different browser
- [ ] Check no other app using camera
- [ ] Check network: `ipconfig`

### Python Issues
If Python detection won't run:
- [ ] Check Python installed: `python --version`
- [ ] Check MediaPipe: `pip list | findstr mediapipe`
- [ ] Reinstall: `pip install --upgrade mediapipe`
- [ ] Check server running: `http://localhost:6527`
- [ ] Check URL in Python script

### Network Issues
If can't connect to localhost:
- [ ] Check firewall allowing port 6527
- [ ] Check Windows Firewall:
  ```bash
  netsh advfirewall add rule name="Node.js" dir=in action=allow program="node.exe"
  ```
- [ ] Try 127.0.0.1:6527 instead of localhost:6527
